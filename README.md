a Generic Simulation Framework for Predicting Virus Transmission between Biological Cells
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to CAPSE - an opensource project is aimed at simulating viral trasmision in a population of cells. This webpage/readme is aimed at introducing you to the project and getting started with using the software.



Background Information about the Project
----------------------------------------
Viruses spread between cells, tissues and organisms by cell-free and cell-cell mechanisms depending on the cell types, viruses or phase of infection cycle.  These two principle modes of transmission can be nearly exclusive, or simultaneous, depending on the virus, cell and time of infection.  The mode of viral transmission has a large impact on disease development and the outcome of anti-viral therapies.  Yet, it has been difficult to distinguish between different transmission modes due to the complex underlying biology.  Using live-cell imaging we have previously characterized the cell-free transmission mode of human adenovirus in monolayers of epithelial cells, and developed an in silico model with multi-scale hybrid dynamics, cellular automata and particle strength exchange.   Here we enhance this model to incorporate cell-to-cell and mixed modes of virus transmission using experimental data for vaccinia virus. We postulate that a generic plaque formation model requires cellular and cell-free components.  Since validation of this postulate requires modeling every virus known, we make our generalized open source simulation framework which is receptive for both experimental and programming contributions through a crowdsourcing platform.  The framework will enable better understanding of key parameters controlling the spatial dynamics of viral spreading.
