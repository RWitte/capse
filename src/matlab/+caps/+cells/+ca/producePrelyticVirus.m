% PRELYTICVIRUSPRODUCTION
%
% prelyticVirusProduction determines  how much virus is produces at the 
% current time step by the virus according to the Sigmoidal Virus Growth 
% model.
% Y=Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(1+10^((LogEC50-X)*HillSlope))
% The model equation is: Y = Bottom + (Top - Bottom)/...
% (1+ 10^((logEC50-t)*Slope)), where Y is the virus amount, t ï¿½ is time after
% infection and "Bottom", "Top", "EC50" and "Slope"  are the fitting 
% parameters.
% Input Arguments: virusType, t, Bottom, Top, EC50 and Slope
